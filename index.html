      <p>In 2010, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a degree in English and Film Studies. <em>Wait. English? Film? I thought you said you were a developer.</em> Let me explain.</p>
      <p>My working years began with a desk job at an education company. As great of an opportunity as that was, I found myself getting a little bored. There was this part of my brain that just wasn't being used to its fullest extent. So I started gravitating toward projects that were a little more technical, projects that had me fixing bugs in XML templates or constructing formulas in Excel. And I realized: I like this kind of thing. I like using technology to <em>solve problems</em>.</p>
      <p>I started thinking seriously about the kind of work I wanted to be doing. And I started reading. I started reading wonderful books like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach" target="_blank"><em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em></a> and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/07/turings-cathedral-george-dyson-review" target="_blank"><em>Turing's Cathedral</em></a>, books that not only introduced me to what programming was but also inspired me to give it a try. I started taking some of those newfangled MOOCs – courses like Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101" target="_blank">Intro to Computer Science</a> and Coursera's <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>. At last! Here was the intellectual stimulation I was craving. I knew I was on the right track.</p>
      <p>So, I decided to take the plunge. I signed up for <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>, an intensive 9-week coding program in Chicago. Each week, I spent 70-100 hours tackling coding challenges and building apps. I learned the fundamentals of Ruby; databases and SQL; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including jQuery); Git; test-driven development and RSpec; Sinatra; and Rails. I also became a whole lot better at giving and receiving feedback, asking questions, and working as part of a team.</p>
      <p>Now I'm looking for a new opportunity to keep learning and keep honing my craft.</p>
