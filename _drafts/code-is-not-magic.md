title: Computers Are Not Magic, Coders Are Not Magicians
---

> In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.
- Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman, *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs*
> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
- Arthur C. Clarke

Both enticing and off-putting to newbies
Magic is in principle beyond understanding; technology is not
Can be used as an excuse to treat technology as black box
Relation to privilege
